# cargo-certora-sbf

A Cargo subcommand that integrates [Certora](https://www.certora.com/) formal verification into Rust-based Solana BPF (SBF) smart contract development workflows.

## 📦 Installation

Install via `cargo install`:

```sh
cargo install cargo-certora-sbf
```

Ensure you have Rust installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). This tool requires Rust version 1.81 or higher.

## 🚀 Usage

Use from the command line just like any other cargo subcommand:

```sh
cargo certora-sbf [OPTIONS]
```

## 🔧 Options

Run cargo certora-sbf --help for the full list of options.

## 🛠 How It Works

`cargo-certora-sbf` automates:
 - Managing Certora Solana Platform Tools (includes a Rust compiler version enhanced for Certora Prover compatibility).
 - Compiling Solana smart contracts into a form suitable for formal verification.
